# Banking-Fraud-Detection-EDA
Data Collection:

Gather data related to the transactions or activities you want to monitor for fraud. This data might include transaction records, user profiles, timestamps, and any other relevant information.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and errors. This ensures that your analysis is based on accurate and complete data.
Transform and standardize data if needed. For example, you might convert text-based categories into numerical values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the data. Some common EDA techniques include:
Descriptive statistics: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary statistics.
Data visualization: Create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize the distribution of data and identify outliers.
Data profiling: Examine data patterns and relationships between variables.
